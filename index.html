  <h1>Tree inequity on Long Island, visualized</h1>
  <h4><i>By Dana Chiueh </i></h4>
<p>Long Island is home to both abundant pine groves and protected forests, and neighborhoods with little tree cover to insulate them from highway air pollution and increasing summer heat waves.

<p>A closer look at the data shows an inequitable distribution of tree cover across the region that disproportionately affects lower-income Long Islanders. According to data from the nonprofit American Forests, while the island has an average Tree Equity Score of 87, certain neighborhoods and pockets have scores as low as 41. 

<p>Some of the lowest-scoring blocks are located along Rte. 25 in Hicksville and Westbury and in Riverhead.

  <p>Tree equity scores measure how much the trees in a neighborhood benefit all residents, and take into account both the amount of tree cover and socioeconomic data about the neighborhood.

<p>Tree cover plays a major role in filtering the air and helping residents keep cool. Besides providing shade, trees also absorb stormwater, easing the effect of floods. <a href="bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-03/some-20-mile-per-hour-streets-are-designed-to-move-faster-traffic-than-others">City planners say</a> the presence of tree canopy on residential streets can also increase road safety as drivers receive a stronger message to slow down. 
<p>Nationally, researchers have found that low-income areas have an average of 15% less tree cover than their affluent counterparts. That could make a difference of between 5 and 20 degrees of heat on a sweltering day, and a significant increase on an A/C bill.
<p>Such heat effects are known as urban heat islands, and have been linked to higher emissions of greenhouse gases, heat-related illnesses and deaths, and worse water quality. 
<p>Outside of nature preserve regions, the majority of trees on Long Island are privately owned. While single-family homeowners may be incentivized to plant more trees to increase property values, these incentives decrease for commercial properties or multifamily housing units, such as retirement homes. To change that, advocates nationwide are asking cities to take the charge to plant more urban tree cover and create policy that encourages companies to plant trees on their properties.
<p>Another priority could be replanting trees alongside busy highway corridors and county roads, which leak tons of carbon emissions into neighboring communities.

<p>By contrast, New York City has a tree equity score of 93.
<p>The township with the lowest tree equity score, Riverhead, also had the lowest median income: $80,595.
